# Requirements

## Windows: <br>
  At least python v3.10.12 or whatever the most current version is. Python can be downloaded from the microsoft store<br>
  At least node v12.22.9. This can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer

# Setup
Setup is really easy. Just double click on the setup.py file and it will automatically download and create everything needed

# Start
To start the program, run the start.py.
As of now there is no real GUI so you just have command line that displays information as it passes through the server.

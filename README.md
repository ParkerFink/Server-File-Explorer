# Requirements

## Windows: <br>
  At least python v3.10.12 or whatever the most current version is. Python can be downloaded from the microsoft store <br>
  At least node v12.22.9. This can be downloaded at https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer <br>

# Setup
There are two main ways to setup the program. <br>
You can run start_cmd.py and type in 'setup' <br>
OR you can double click on setup.py <br>
Next you will want to edit your config file to have it run on the right URL: <br>
In stat_cmd.py, type 'config ip *your ip*' to change the IP. 'config port *port*' changes the port. <br>  



# Start
To start the program, run start_cmd.py. This will open a terminal looking window, this is where you will type all your commands for the server. <br>
Once start_cmd.py is open, type 'start' to run the server. As long as you have no error codes, your server is now running and fully functional. <br>
